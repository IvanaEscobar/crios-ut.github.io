The ocean's overturning circulation redistributes heat, salt and dissolved chemicals around the globe, from the surface to great depths. Variations in overturning have been linked to significant climate change on a range of timescales, but the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Exploring the cause of observed variations and quantifying the relative importance of various external (atmospheric) forcings versus internal (eddy induced) processes is complex but essential for understanding past and present climate states and anticipating future change.

Most of our group's research on this topic has aimed to unambiguously attribute variations in net overturning and its constituent currents to past changes in external forcing. Our main tool for this task is the [ECCO state estimate](https://ecco-group.org/) and inbuilt adjoint infrastructure, enabling efficient mapping of the timescales and pathways of overturning sensitivity to prior atmospheric changes. These sensitivity distributions provide insights into the underlying adjustment physics and - via convolution with historic atmospheric forcing estimates - enable contributions from wind, heat and freshwater forcing to be both seperately quantified and pinpointed in space and time.
